    NOTES:

    * The score stuff seems pretty much worked out. I think I like the function I have, as it seems to be the most
      fair. It takes into account the velocity of the balls, as well as how many you have and how long you lasted.
      A game with four really slow balls is much easier than a game with two really fast ones.
    * Consider making a RESTful service with this and deploying it to do all the playtesting. Just have an open node
      that takes in all the data in the debug section and pushes it to a database. It should be really simple to do
      using Sinatra. Then post the game all over the place and see how it ends up working out.
    * A local and global multiplayer version would be kinda cool.
    * Consider making all the balls bounce instead of moving to the other side super fast.
